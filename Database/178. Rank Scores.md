# 178. Rank Scores

## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/)
```
Write a SQL query to rank scores. 
If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. 
Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. 
In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+

For example, 
given the above Scores table, 
your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

SELECT s1.Score, s2.Rank FROM Score s1,
(
    SELECT s1.Score, count(1) AS Rank FROM
        (SELECT DISTINCT Score FROM Score) s1,
        (SELECT DISTINCT Score FROM Score) s2
    WHERE s1.Score<=s2.Score
    GROUP BY s1.Score
) s2
WHERE s1.Score=s2.Score
ORDER BY s1.Score DESC;
